  Describe the task for the AI to complete.

  Be specific about:
  1. What needs to be done

  3. Any constraints or requirements

  Example:
  "Fix the authentication function in src/auth.py so that it
  properly validates empty passwords. The fix should return
  an appropriate error message."

# Path to your fixture project (relative to this file)
fixture_path: ../fixtures/your-project

assertions:
  # Objective check: tests pass
  - type: code
    check: tests_pass
    command: "uv run pytest tests/ -v"  # or your test command

  # Objective check: file contains expected pattern
  - type: code
    check: file_contains
    file: "src/your-file.py"
    pattern: "expected_pattern"  # regex

  # Subjective check: LLM evaluates quality
  - type: llm
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the implementation against your skill's principles:

      1. First Principle (0-25 points):
         - Does the code follow principle X?
         - Is pattern Y applied correctly?

      2. Second Principle (0-25 points):
         - Does the code follow principle Z?
         - Are edge cases handled?

      3. Code Quality (0-25 points):
         - Is the code clean and readable?
         - Are there appropriate comments?

      4. Overall (0-25 points):
         - Would this pass code review?
         - Is it production-ready?
