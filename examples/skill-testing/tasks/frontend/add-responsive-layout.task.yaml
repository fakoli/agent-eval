description: Make the layout responsive and mobile-friendly
difficulty: medium

prompt: |
  The current layout is fixed-width (800px) and doesn't work on mobile devices.

  Make the layout responsive:
  1. Use fluid widths instead of fixed (max-width instead of width)
  2. Add media queries for different screen sizes
  3. Ensure text remains readable on small screens
  4. Fix any color contrast issues you find while working on this

  The app should work well on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+).

      Evaluate the responsive design against frontend principles:

      1. Layout Approach (0-25 points):
         - Uses fluid/flexible widths (max-width, percentage, etc.)?
         - Has appropriate breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop?
         - Content reflows properly at different sizes?

      2. Typography (0-25 points):
         - Text remains readable at all sizes?
         - Uses relative units (rem/em) for font sizes?
         - Line length is appropriate (45-75 characters)?

      3. Spacing & Touch Targets (0-25 points):
         - Uses consistent spacing scale?
         - Touch targets are appropriately sized (44x44px min)?
         - Padding adjusts appropriately for mobile?

      4. Visual Quality (0-25 points):
         - Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text)?
         - Design looks intentional at all breakpoints?
         - No horizontal scrolling on mobile?
