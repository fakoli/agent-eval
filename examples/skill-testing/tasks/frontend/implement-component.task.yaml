description: Implement a card component following design system principles
difficulty: medium

prompt: |
  Create a reusable TaskCard component that displays a single task. The component
  should be extracted from the current inline task rendering in app.js.

  Requirements:
  1. Create a new function `createTaskCard(task)` that returns a DOM element
  2. The card should be accessible (proper ARIA, keyboard support)
  3. Use consistent spacing and follow a design scale
  4. Include proper focus states

  Replace the inline task rendering in renderTasks() to use this new component.

fixture_path: ../../fixtures/frontend-app

assertions:
  - type: code
    check: file_contains
    file: "src/app.js"
    pattern: "function createTaskCard"
  - type: code
    check: file_contains
    file: "src/styles.css"
    pattern: ":focus"
  - type: llm
    rubric: |
      Evaluate the component implementation against design principles:

      1. Component Design (0-25 points):
         - Is the component properly encapsulated and reusable?
         - Does it follow atomic design principles (atoms → molecules)?
         - Is the API clear (what parameters, what it returns)?

      2. Accessibility (0-25 points):
         - Does it use proper semantic elements (button for actions)?
         - Does it have keyboard support?
         - Does it announce state changes to screen readers?

      3. Visual Design (0-25 points):
         - Does it use consistent spacing (design scale, not arbitrary)?
         - Does it have proper visual hierarchy?
         - Are focus states visible and clear?

      4. Code Quality (0-25 points):
         - Is the code clean and maintainable?
         - Are there comments explaining the component's purpose?
         - Is it integrated properly with the existing code?

  file_contains: 30
