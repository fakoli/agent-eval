description: Fix accessibility issues in the task list component
difficulty: medium

prompt: |
  The task list app has several accessibility issues. Fix the following:

  1. Add proper semantic HTML structure (header, main, footer, nav)
  2. Add labels to form inputs
  3. Make the task items keyboard accessible (they should respond to Enter/Space)
  4. Add alt text to images
  5. Add a skip link for keyboard users

  The app should work for screen reader users and keyboard-only users.

    rubric: |
      Evaluate the accessibility fixes against frontend design principles:

      1. Semantic Structure (0-25 points):
         - Uses semantic HTML elements (header, main, nav, footer)?
         - Has proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)?
         - Has skip link for keyboard navigation?

      2. Form Accessibility (0-25 points):
         - Input has associated label (for/id or aria-label)?
         - Button has accessible name (visible text or aria-label)?
         - Error messages are accessible?

      3. Interactive Elements (0-25 points):
         - Clickable elements use button or link elements?
         - Keyboard focus is visible?
         - Keyboard events (Enter/Space) work?

      4. Images and Icons (0-25 points):
         - Images have descriptive alt text?
         - Icon-only buttons have aria-labels?
         - Decorative images are marked appropriately?
