# Project-specific instructions
claude_md: |
  # Python Utils Project

  ## Code Style
  - Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
  - Include docstrings for all public functions (Google style)
  - Keep functions focused and small (< 20 lines)

  ## Testing
  - Run tests before and after making changes: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
  - Read the test file first to understand expected behavior
  - Don't modify tests unless explicitly asked

  ## Error Handling
  - Use specific exception types (ValueError, TypeError, etc.)
  - Include helpful error messages
  - Document exceptions in docstrings with Raises section

  ## Workflow
  1. Read the relevant source file first
  2. Read the corresponding test file
  3. Make minimal changes to fix the issue
  4. Run tests to verify
