description: Fix the division by zero bug in the calculator module
difficulty: easy

prompt: |
  The `divide` function in `src/calculator.py` has a bug - it doesn't handle
  division by zero. When someone calls `divide(10, 0)`, it should raise a
  `ValueError` with a message about division by zero.

  Fix this bug so all the tests pass.

fixture_path: ../fixtures/python-utils

assertions:
  # Primary check: all tests pass
  - type: code
    check: tests_pass
    command: "python -m pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v"

  # Verify the fix was applied correctly
  - type: code
    check: file_contains
    file: src/calculator.py
    pattern: "ValueError|ZeroDivisionError"

  # Ensure we didn't break anything
  - type: code
    check: file_contains
    file: src/calculator.py
    pattern: "def divide"

scoring:
  tests_pass: 70
  file_contains: 30

timeout_seconds: 120
